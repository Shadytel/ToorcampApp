    <string name="wifi_config_info">The Toorcamp #noc is proud to present several options for
        fast, free WiFi this year! With a 10Gbps uplink graceously offered by Rock Island Internet,
        and backups provided by SpaceX, we should have plenty of bandwidth to meet your needs.
        However, wireless spectrum is a scarce resource, so PLEASE use our WiFi instead of setting
        up your own!

        \n\nYou\'ll likely want to use the default settings. This protects you and your device
        from fake Access Points impersonating the Toorcamp network, and blocks all
        incoming traffic from others. You get a safe, authenticated, outbound-only
        NATed connection to the Internet.

        \n\nHowever, if you would like a public IP address, or want to host a service
        from your device, you can choose our new "Fully Exposed" service, with dedicated
        IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for your device. You may also register DNS entries under
        toor.camp for your device/services. However, YOU are responsible for the security
        of your device! It is DIRECTLY connected to the Internet with NO FIREWALL and NO
        ADDRESS TRANSLATION. Proceed with this profile ONLY if you fully understand the
        implications of this.
